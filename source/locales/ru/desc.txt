"A marker that helps you to read long pages" : "Маркер прокрутки - помощь при чтении длинных страниц"

"Scroll Marker helps you to read long texts on web pages. When you read a long text, you must often scroll the page, so you may miss the mark. Scroll Marker draw a marker that shows you where was the end of the page before scroll it. In this way you can easly find the mark.

This function was in an older Opera version, but was removed in new versions.

You can activate or deactivate the marker using a popup. Alternatively you can choose to automaticaly activate the marker on certain web sites, that are in a list created by the user. The list can be also a blacklist, so the marker will be always active, but not on the listed sites.

If you want to translate this extension you can email me or visit support page.

Thanks to OK3 for having suggested the idea, and for his help in realization.
